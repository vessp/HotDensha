-----------------
  A simple React-Native app which lets the me easily check if I have to run, walk quickly, or can take it easy while getting to my next train.  This is a no-fuss, no-clutter, just open and see exactly the information you need app.  Since I also go to the same stations to catch the train I usually just needed to know how many seconds I have left to get there, and I want to know quickly and without needing to press any buttons.

  The app tracks my location and distance from the nearest stations around me and lets me know how much leeway I have to make the next train.
